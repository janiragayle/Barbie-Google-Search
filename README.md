# Google-Homepage
Programmer: Janira Gayle

To help myself learn HTML and CSS I re-implemented a front-end for Google's search homepage. From this home page, you can click on the hyperlinks in the upper right corner to get 
to a re-implementation of Google's advanced search page and image search page. 

To view go to:
https://htmlpreview.github.io/? 
and paste https://github.com/janiragayle/Google-Homepage/blob/main/index.html into searchbar
